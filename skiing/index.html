	<h2> What Skiing Means To Me</h2>
	<p> To me skiing is the best winter sport. I started skiing when I was about 4 yrs old. I've been skiing every year since then. My favorite resort to go skiing is Alta. 
		My favorite thing to do while skiing is skiing in powder. I find this extremely fun when theres a lot of powder. I've skied across almost all the main resorts in the SLC and Park City area. </p>
	<h2>Time Line</h2> 
  		<ul>
			<li>Started Skiing at Alta when I was 4.</li>
			<li>Stayed at Alta for the next year.</li>
			<li>The next year we got Brighton season passes.</li>
			<li>Stayed with Brighton passes for the next 3 ish years.</li>
	  		<li>For the next 3 years we got Ikon passes so we could move to different resorts to ski.</li>
			<li>After those three years we went back to Alta passes</li>
			<li>Then we stayed with Alta passes for the next 3 years.</li>
			<li>This year was a little different. We wanted to be able to go to Alta and more resorts, so we got Alta season passes, as well as Ikon base passes.</li>
		</ul>
